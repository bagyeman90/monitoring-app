# ** Cloud-Native Monitoring Application **
## **This project is a cloud-native monitoring application built using Python. The application is containerized using Docker and deployed to AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) using Terraform.** [1]

### Introduction
The Cloud-Native Monitoring Application is a Python-based tool that provides real-time monitoring and observability for cloud-based infrastructure and applications. It leverages various AWS services, including Amazon EKS, Amazon ECR, and Terraform Cloud, to deliver a scalable and reliable monitoring solution.

## Getting Started**

* Building the Docker Image

* Pushing the Docker Image to DockerHub

* Pushing the Docker Image to AWS ECR [2]

* Deploying to AWS EKS

* Terraform Configuration [3]

* Monitoring and Observability


# Architecture
The application architecture consists of the following components:

## **Docker** Image:
### Build the Docker image using the following command:

``` docker build -t flask-app .```

### Running the image in the terminal:

``` docker run -p 5000:5000 flask-app ```

Initialize the Terraform working directory:

COPY ``` terraform init``` 
Review the Terraform configuration and make any necessary changes.

Apply the Terraform configuration to create the EKS cluster and deploy the application:

Copy
``` terraform apply``` 
Terraform Configuration
The Terraform configuration for this project is stored in the 
terraform
 directory. It includes the following resources:

## **AWS provider configuration**

## **EKS cluster**

## **ECR repository**

## **Kubernetes resources (deployment, service, etc.)**

## **Terraform Cloud backend configuration**

The Python application is packaged as a Docker image and stored in both DockerHub and Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).

## **AWS EKS:** 
The Docker image is deployed to an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster, which provides a managed Kubernetes environment.

## **Terraform:** 
The entire infrastructure, including the EKS cluster, ECR repository, and other AWS resources, is provisioned and managed using Terraform.

## The Terraform state is stored in Terraform Cloud.

``` docker push your-dockerhub-username/my-monitoring-app ``` 
## **Pushing the Docker Image to AWS ECR**

Create an ECR repository in the AWS Management Console with Terraform.

Log in to the ECR repository:

``` aws ecr get-login-password --region <your-aws-region> | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <your-ecr-repository-uri>``` 

Tag the Docker image with the ECR repository URI:

``` docker tag my-monitoring-app <your-ecr-repository-uri>/my-monitoring-app ``` 

Push the Docker image to ECR:

Copy
``` docker push <your-ecr-repository-uri>/my-monitoring-app``` 

## **Deploying to AWS EKS**
### **Navigate to the Terraform directory in your project.**



You can customize the Terraform configuration to fit your specific requirements, such as adjusting the instance types, scaling options, and other parameters.

Monitoring and Observability
The Cloud-Native Monitoring Application leverages AWS services for monitoring and observability, including:

Amazon CloudWatch for logging and metrics

AWS X-Ray for distributed tracing

AWS CloudTrail for auditing and security monitoring

You can configure these services in the Terraform configuration or through the AWS Management Console.
